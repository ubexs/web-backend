# Gotcha's
A list of features and documentation that might be unexpected or unknown.

### Important UserIDs
**1** - UserID 1 is expected to be the system account. Any hats created, system messages, etc, will be attributed to this UserID. Some features on the account may also be broken, such as the inability to resell collectible items. UserID 1 must also exist for the website to operate.

**50** - UserID 50 is used for the collectibles rollback system. The idea is that when an account is compromised, it is possible for the staff to give the compromised user new collectible items in place of their old ones. Collectible Items can be transferred from terminated accounts to this account, by staff, for easier collectible management. This account must be owned by a staff member and/or be terminated.

### Avatar Rendering
There is no open source avatar rendering system due to licensing issues. You will have to create your own.
